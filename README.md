# DECODER

This is a front-end project created with the goal of exercising HTML, CSS & Javascript skills lernt in the ONE - Oracle Next Education program course series. 

The functionality of this website is simple. It encodes whatever word or sentence you write in the text-box. You can also decode a sentence made in this page.
The encoding mechanism replaces each vocal in a word as follows:

a --> ai
e --> enter
i --> imes
o --> ober
u --> ufat

You can access the final version here: https://decoder-alura-three.vercel.app/
